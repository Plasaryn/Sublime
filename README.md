# Sublime
Contains the Sublime 3 Configuration files I enjoy using

To install these packages on Windows devices, within Sublime, perform Ctrl+Shift+P, and submit the command "Install Package Control".

Once Package Control is installed, copy the files of this distribution to "APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User", 
make a backup of the exitsting SUBLIME-SETTINGS files if desired, then add these settings files to that directory.
